engine/packet_bridge.py — PacketEnvelope construction helpers for GRAPH

All outbound packets MUST be built via this module.
Direct TransportPacket instantiation in handler code is forbidden.

Provides:
    build_request_packet  — construct an outbound PacketEnvelope
    build_response_packet — construct a reply preserving inbound lineage
    extract_payload       — safely extract decoded payload dict

L9 contracts enforced:
    - trace_id propagation       (missing_trace_id)
    - tenant isolation           (tenant_isolation_violation)
    - lineage preservation       (packet_protocol_violation)
    - immutability               (derive() used, never direct mutation)
