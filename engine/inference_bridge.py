"""
GAP-9 FIX: Replace engine/inference_bridge.py with this file.

Any direct import of the v1 bridge now raises ImportError immediately,
forcing all callers to migrate to inference_bridge_v2.py (DAG engine).

This eliminates silent bypass of the DerivationGraph topological sort
and unlock-value targeting that the v1 bridge was causing.
