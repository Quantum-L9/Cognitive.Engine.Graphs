Outcome feedback loop for weight tuning proposals.

Reads outcome data (positive/negative/neutral) from Neo4j, computes
per-dimension discriminability, and proposes weight adjustments. Does NOT
auto-apply — returns proposals for human-in-the-loop approval.

seL4 analog: the feedback mechanism closes the refinement loop — the
abstract target (calibration spec) constrains where the concrete weights
are allowed to move.
