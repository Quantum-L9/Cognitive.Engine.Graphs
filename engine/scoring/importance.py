Visit-count importance scoring dimension.

Implements the IMP metric from HopRAG (ACL 2025, §3.3.3):

    IMP(v_i, C_count) = C_count[v_i] / sum(C_count)

where C_count is a dictionary mapping vertex IDs to visit counts
accumulated during multi-hop BFS traversal. Vertices visited more
frequently from different reasoning paths are considered more important.

Consumes:
- Visit count data from MultiHopTraverser BFS results
- Candidate node property `visit_count` (written by traverser)

Integrates with:
- engine.scoring.assembler.ScoringAssembler (via ComputationType.IMPORTANCE dispatch)
- engine.scoring.helpfulness.HelpfulnessScorer (provides IMP component)
- engine.traversal.multihop.MultiHopTraverser (produces visit counts)
