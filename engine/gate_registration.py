engine/gate_registration.py — Gate self-registration hook for Cognitive.Engine.Graphs

Called from GraphLifecycle.startup() after init_dependencies().
Registration failure is intentionally non-fatal — the node starts regardless
and Gate will discover it on the next health poll.

Boot patch — add inside GraphLifecycle.startup() after init_dependencies():

    from engine.gate_registration import register_node_with_gate
    await register_node_with_gate()
