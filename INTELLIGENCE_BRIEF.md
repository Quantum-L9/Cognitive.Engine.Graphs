# CEG Intelligence Architecture — Value Brief

**L9 Labs** | March 2026

> A knowledge graph that learns from every outcome and gets smarter with every deal.

## The Problem

Traditional matching systems are static. Rules don't adapt, signals aren't weighted by actual outcomes, and there's no feedback loop. Every deal that closes — won or lost — is a learning opportunity wasted. The system makes the same mistakes repeatedly because it never learns from results.

## The Solution

CEG is a self-improving cognitive engine. It transforms domain data into an inference-bearing knowledge graph, then closes the feedback loop — learning from every outcome to automatically refine future matches. The more deals that close, the smarter it gets.

## Five Capabilities

### 1. Self-Learning Match Intelligence
The engine learns which factors actually predict wins vs. losses. Signal weights auto-adjust based on real outcomes using a statistically rigorous lift formula with confidence intervals — not human intuition.

**Key metric:** Matches improve automatically with every closed deal.

### 2. Causal Intelligence
CEG distinguishes "X happened before Y" from "X caused Y" using 10 causal edge types with temporal validation. Causal chains, attribution modeling, and root cause analysis replace guesswork.

**Key metric:** Know WHY deals close, not just THAT they close.

### 3. Counterfactual Analysis
For every loss, the system auto-generates intervention scenarios: "What if we had changed X?" with validated confidence scores derived from historical winning configurations.

**Key metric:** Turn every loss into a playbook for the next win.

### 4. Intelligent Entity Resolution
Automatically identifies and merges duplicate records across data sources using a triple-signal approach: property matching, graph structure analysis, and behavioral pattern comparison.

**Key metric:** Clean data without manual deduplication.

### 5. Match Quality Monitoring
Continuous drift detection using statistical divergence measures alerts when matching behavior shifts — catching data quality issues, weight recalibration overshoots, or market changes before they impact results.

**Key metric:** Problems detected automatically, not after damage is done.

## Grounded in Research

Built on techniques from three peer-reviewed research programs:

- **Microsoft Research** — Algorithmic fingerprinting and compositional reasoning geometry enable the feedback loop's weight learning system
- **Pinterest Engineering** — Multi-signal representation learning (graph + content + behavioral) powers the entity resolution system, delivering 2.5x better similarity matching in production at Pinterest scale
- **Renmin University + Alibaba** — Subgraph reasoning techniques enable causal chain traversal and counterfactual generation with 36% improvement over prior state-of-the-art

## By the Numbers

- **6 PRs**, **70+ files**, **200+ tests**
- **10 security findings** resolved (1 critical RCE eliminated)
- **5 subsystems**: feedback loop, causal edges, entity resolution, counterfactuals, drift detection
- **All features** domain-spec-driven, zero-risk activation
- **Closed-loop learning** — outcomes feed back into scoring automatically

## The Closed Loop

```
Match Request → Gate-then-Score → Results
                                     ↓
                           Outcome Recorded
                                     ↓
                           Learning Engine
                           (weights, patterns, drift)
                                     ↓
                           Improved Scoring
                                     ↓
                           Next Match → Better Results
```
