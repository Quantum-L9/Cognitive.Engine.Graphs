# Contract Verification

Run the full CEG contract enforcement pipeline.

## Quick Check
```bash
python tools/contract_scanner.py
```
Scans for banned patterns. Maps violations to contract IDs (SEC-001 → Contract 9, ARCH-001 → Contract 1).

## Full Verification
```bash
python tools/verify_contracts.py
```
Verifies all 20 contract doc files exist and are wired to the scanner.

## Manual Contract Audit
For each contract, verify:
1. **Static check**: Does contract_scanner.py have a rule for it?
2. **Unit test**: Does tests/contracts/ have a test for it?
3. **Integration test**: Is the contract exercised end-to-end?
4. **Property test**: Are invariants checked with Hypothesis?
