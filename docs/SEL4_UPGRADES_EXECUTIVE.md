# Cognitive Engine Graphs — Verified Intelligence Upgrade

**Product**: Cognitive Engine Graphs (CEG)
**Upgrade Program**: Formally-Verified OS Kernel Design Principles Applied to Graph Matching
**Date**: March 2026

---

## The Opportunity

Cognitive Engine Graphs is a domain-configurable graph matching and scoring engine built on Neo4j. It powers intelligent candidate matching across configurable domains — connecting the right entities through multi-dimensional scoring, configurable filtering gates, and graph-based intelligence algorithms.

This upgrade program applies design principles from **the world's first formally-verified operating system kernel** — seL4, proven correct by mathematical proof at SOSP 2009 — to harden CEG's matching accuracy, security posture, operational resilience, and feature completeness. The result: an engine that doesn't just match — it matches with provable guarantees.

---

## What Changed: Six Upgrade Waves

### Wave 1 — Match Accuracy Guarantees

Every score CEG returns is now mathematically bounded to [0, 1]. Every domain configuration is validated at load time against a cross-reference integrity check. Every graph traversal is bounded, every parameter is verified, and every gate filter is null-safe.

**Business impact**: Clients can treat scores as probabilities. Configuration errors are caught before they reach production. No more silent failures.

---

### Wave 2 — Scoring Intelligence

CEG now includes a calibration framework that lets operators define expected score ranges for known entity pairs and verify the engine delivers correct results. A feedback loop accepts real-world outcome data (positive/negative match results) and proposes weight adjustments — with mandatory human approval before any change is applied. Confidence flags alert consumers when a single scoring dimension dominates the result.

**Business impact**: Scoring quality is measurable, auditable, and improvable over time. Operators gain control over matching precision without touching code.

---

### Wave 3 — Enterprise-Grade Security

A full capability-based access control model now governs every CEG action. Tenant isolation is enforced at the JWT level — no tenant can access another tenant's data. Fine-grained permissions map every action (match, sync, admin, KGE) to a required capability. Capability delegation between tenants is audited with full provenance tracking.

**Business impact**: CEG is multi-tenant ready for enterprise deployment. Meets enterprise security review requirements. Full audit trail for compliance.

---

### Wave 4 — Operational Resilience

All engine state is encapsulated in a single managed container with proper lifecycle management. A circuit breaker protects against cascading failure during database outages — the engine fails fast with a clear 503 instead of hanging. Domain configuration caching is bounded and time-limited. Audit data persists reliably through periodic flushing.

**Business impact**: Higher uptime, faster recovery from infrastructure issues, predictable resource usage, and no lost audit data.

---

### Wave 5 — Automated Quality Assurance

316 automated tests now verify every architectural contract, every fixed defect, and every scoring quality baseline. Property-based testing exercises the gate compiler and scoring assembler with thousands of randomly-generated inputs. A standalone validation tool lets domain authors verify their configurations before deployment.

**Business impact**: Every code change is automatically verified against the full quality baseline. Regression risk approaches zero. New domain configurations are validated before they can cause issues.

---

### Wave 6 — Dormant Capability Activation

CEG ships with ~2,000 lines of previously-dormant intelligence: a CompoundE3D knowledge graph embedding model for learned similarity scoring, GDPR Article 17 erasure compliance, GDS algorithm monitoring and manual triggering, and structured feature gate documentation. Each capability now has a safe, documented activation pathway with validation gates and rollback procedures.

**Business impact**: Unlocked capabilities that were built but never reachable. KGE adds a fifth scoring dimension using learned embeddings. GDPR compliance enables EU market deployment. Operations gains visibility into graph intelligence algorithm health.

## The seL4 Advantage

seL4 is the gold standard for systems that must never fail. It is the only general-purpose OS kernel in the world with a complete formal proof of functional correctness — used in military systems, autonomous vehicles, and critical infrastructure.

We applied seL4's core design philosophy to CEG:

- **Invariant Preservation** — If it can be checked, it is checked. Every input, every score, every configuration.
- **Capability-Based Security** — Access is not binary. Every action requires a specific, auditable, revocable capability.
- **State Encapsulation** — No hidden mutable globals. All state is managed, bounded, and lifecycle-aware.
- **Mechanism / Policy Separation** — The engine proves the mechanism works. The operator decides when to activate it.
- **Verification-Driven Quality** — Testing is not an afterthought. Every contract has a test. Every defect has a regression guard.

---

## Competitive Differentiators

1. **Provable scoring guarantees** — No other graph matching engine bounds every score to [0, 1] with mathematical enforcement at the query level.

2. **Calibration-verified matching** — Operators can define expected outcomes and verify the engine delivers them — a concept borrowed directly from formal verification.

3. **Enterprise-grade multi-tenant security** — Capability-based access control with delegation trees and revocation proofs, modeled after the world's most secure OS kernel.

4. **Self-healing resilience** — Circuit breaker pattern, bounded caching, and periodic audit flushing mean CEG recovers automatically from infrastructure disruptions.

5. **Five-dimensional scoring** — Structural, geographic, reinforcement, freshness, and now learned embeddings (KGE) — each independently weighted, bounded, and auditable.

6. **GDPR-ready by design** — Article 17 erasure built into the engine with dry-run safety, idempotency, and immediate audit persistence.

7. **316-test quality baseline** — Every code change is verified against contract tests, invariant regression tests, scoring benchmarks, and property-based fuzzing.

---

## Deployment Flexibility

Every enhancement ships with a feature flag defaulting to a safe state. Operators can:

- **Enable incrementally** — Turn on individual features as infrastructure readiness permits
- **Roll back instantly** — Every flag can be toggled without code deployment
- **Validate before activation** — Domain-spec validation CLI catches configuration errors offline
- **Monitor activation** — `feature_status` admin endpoint reports the current state of all 20+ gates

---

## Technical Foundation

Built on proven technologies and patterns:

- **Neo4j** graph database with GDS (Graph Data Science) library
- **FastAPI** async HTTP framework with Pydantic validation
- **CompoundE3D** knowledge graph embedding model
- **Hypothesis** property-based testing framework
- **asyncio** event-driven concurrency (single-stack, no threading)
- **cachetools** bounded TTL caching

---

## What's Next

With the verification foundation in place, the following capabilities are unlocked for future development:

- **Compiled Domain Packs** — Pre-compile YAML specs into optimized query templates for sub-millisecond request-time assembly
- **PostgreSQL Persistence** — Durable storage for audit logs, outcome feedback, and capability delegation records
- **Constellation Orchestration** — Multi-engine federation for cross-domain matching at scale
- **LLM-Assisted Matching** — Validated LLM client with schema enforcement and security controls already in place
