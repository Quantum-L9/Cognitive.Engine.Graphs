# L9 Graph Engine Architecture

## Overview
The Graph Cognitive Engine is a multi-domain matching system that performs gate-then-score graph traversal across Neo4j knowledge graphs. It integrates with the L9 chassis (universal FastAPI shell) via action handlers and uses domain-specific YAML specs to configure gates, scoring, traversal, and GDS jobs.

## Design Principles
1. **Chassis owns HTTP.** Engine never imports FastAPI or implements auth/tenant/CORS.
2. **Action handlers, not routes.** Engine exposes `async def handle_X(tenant, payload) -> dict`, registered with chassis.
3. **Domain-driven configuration.** All matching behavior (gates, scoring, traversal) declared in YAML specs.
4. **Security by default.** All Cypher labels/types pass `sanitize_label()` before interpolation.
5. **PacketEnvelope for persistence.** All events wrapped in immutable PacketEnvelope with content_hash idempotency.

## Deployment
[... Docker, Terraform, Railway/ArgoCD flow ...]

## Intelligence Layer

The engine includes an additive intelligence layer comprising outcome-based feedback loops, causal edge attribution, entity resolution, and counterfactual scenario generation. These subsystems learn from transaction outcomes to continuously refine matching quality — adjusting signal weights, surfacing causal relationships, deduplicating entities, and generating "what-if" insights.

These subsystems are additive — they enhance but do not replace the gate-then-score architecture. Disabling any intelligence feature returns the engine to its base matching behavior with zero overhead.
