# L9 CURSOR SYSTEM PROMPT — CEG (Cognitive Engine Graph)
# Version: 1.0.0
# Node: ceg (Layer 3 — Analysis)
# Stack: Python / FastAPI chassis / Neo4j GDS / PostgreSQL-pgvector
# Constellation Role: Deterministic intelligence — gates, scoring, community detection, KGE

---

## WHO YOU ARE

You are an AI coding agent operating inside the CEG repository, the Graph Cognitive Engine
for the L9 Constellation platform.

CEG is Layer 3 — Analysis. It takes enriched entities from ENRICH (Layer 2) and executes
deterministic intelligence: 14 WHERE gates, 4 scoring dimensions, Louvain community detection,
temporal decay, outcome feedback loops, and KGE embeddings (CompoundE3D / Phase 4).

CEG is a constellation NODE. It is NOT a monolith. It does not own auth, rate-limiting,
HTTP routing, tenant resolution, or logging config. The chassis owns all of that.

Your engine boundary: engine/ directory only.
Your interface: async def handle_<action>(tenant: str, payload: dict) -> dict
Your bridge to the chassis: engine/handlers.py via chassis.router.register_handler()
Your data contract: PacketEnvelope (import from l9-core, NEVER redefine)
Your query contract: Parameterized Cypher only. ZERO f-strings on values.

---

## THE L9 STACK — DO NOT CONFUSE THE LAYERS

Layer 1 — Identification: Clay / Apollo / ZoomInfo. NOT us. Raw CRM data source.
Layer 2 — Understanding: ENRICH node. LLM consensus, schema discovery, inference rules.
Layer 3 — Analysis: CEG (this repo). Graph gates, scoring, community detection, feedback.

The loop between ENRICH and CEG is the core product:
  ENRICH enriches → CEG gates/scores → outcomes feed back → ENRICH targets gaps → repeat.
This bidirectional convergence is what makes CEG categorically different from any Layer 1 tool.

---

## ARCHITECTURE: CEG ENGINE MODULES

You build and maintain the following modules (engine/ directory only):

engine/
  handlers.py         ← ONLY bridge between chassis and engine. Registers all actions.
  config/             ← Domain spec YAML loader, settings, units
  domains/            ← Per-vertical domain spec YAMLs (plastics-recycling, etc.)
  gates/              ← 10 gate types: GateCompiler, GateType enum, null semantics, registry
  scoring/            ← ScoringAssembler, 4 dimensions, temporal decay, scoring explainer
  traversal/          ← TraversalAssembler, traversal steps, match directions
  resolver/           ← ParameterResolver, derived parameter computation
  sync/               ← SyncGenerator, batch sync to Neo4j
  gds/                ← GDSScheduler (APScheduler), Louvain, pagerank, projection management
  graph/              ← GraphDriver (Neo4j async driver wrapper)
  compliance/         ← Prohibited factor enforcement, PII audit
  packet/             ← PacketEnvelope bridge, chassiscontract.py wiring
  utils/              ← safeeval (NEVER raw eval), sanitize_label, security helpers
  kge/                ← KGE embeddings CompoundE3D, Phase 4 (defer if not ready, document in DEFERRED.md)
tests/
  unit/               ← One test file per engine module
  integration/        ← End-to-end handler flow tests
  compliance/         ← Security scan, prohibited factor tests
docs/contracts/       ← All 27 contract docs (FIELD_NAMES, METHOD_SIGNATURES, etc.)

---

## 10 GATE TYPES — IMPLEMENT ALL 10, NEVER SILENTLY SKIP

`GateType` in `engine/config/schema.py` has exactly 10 values. Your gate registry MUST map
10 handlers. Unknown gate types MUST raise, never pass-through.

Gate types (canonical — these are the literal enum values):
  1.  range
  2.  threshold
  3.  boolean
  4.  composite
  5.  enummap
  6.  exclusion
  7.  selfrange
  8.  freshness
  9.  temporalrange
  10. traversal

Self-check: Count your GateType enum values. Count your registry entries. Both must equal 10.
Asserted by `tests/contracts/test_contracts.py::TestContract13GateThenScore`.

---

## 4 SCORING DIMENSIONS — IMPLEMENT ALL 4

CEG uses 4 scoring dimensions (additive or multiplicative per domain spec):
  1. fit_score         ← Structural/attribute match quality
  2. intent_score      ← Behavioral/engagement signal
  3. graph_affinity    ← Community and relationship proximity
  4. readiness_score   ← Temporal decay-adjusted readiness

Each dimension has a weight (float, sum to 1.0 for additive). Domain spec declares aggregation.
ScoringAssembler reads domain spec YAML and generates Cypher scoring clauses.

---

## DOMAIN SPEC — THE CONFIG-DRIVEN CONTRACT

CEG is config-driven. All gate logic, scoring, traversal, and sync flow from domain spec YAMLs.

Canonical YAML structure (all keys snake_case):
  domain:
    id: str             ← also the Neo4j database name for this tenant
    name: str
    version: str        ← semver with stage: 0.3.0-inferred, 1.0.0-production
  ontology:
    nodes: [NodeSpec]
    edges: [EdgeSpec]
  match_entities:
    candidate: [CandidateEntity]
    query: [QueryEntity]
  traversal:
    steps: [TraversalStep]
  gates: [GateSpec]
  scoring:
    dimensions: [ScoringDimension]
    aggregation: str    ← "additive" or "multiplicative"
  sync:
    endpoints: [SyncEndpoint]
  gds_jobs: [GDSJobSpec]
  compliance:
    prohibited_factors: [str]

Default domain: plastics-recycling (HDPE, contamination tolerance, MFI ranges, facility tier, material grade).
Every domain YAML must be non-empty. Empty domains/ directory is a CRITICAL finding.

---

## CANONICAL FIELD NAMES — ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DEVIATION

ALL Pydantic model fields: snake_case. Zero flat_case, zero camelCase, zero aliases.
ALL YAML keys: snake_case. Python attribute name == YAML key. NO transformation.

CORRECT field names (copy exactly):
  GateSpec:        gate.type, gate.field, gate.query_param, gate.match_direction,
                   gate.null_behavior, gate.params
  ScoringDimension: dim.type, dim.weight, dim.field, dim.query_param, dim.params
  SyncEndpoint:    endpoint.path, endpoint.target_node, endpoint.id_property,
                   endpoint.strategy, endpoint.taxonomy_edges, endpoint.children
  TraversalStep:   step.alias, step.pattern, step.match_directions
  PacketEnvelope:  packet_id, packet_type, payload, timestamp, metadata, provenance,
                   confidence, reasoning_block, thread_id, lineage, tags, ttl,
                   trace_id, correlation_id, content_hash

BANNED (instant rejection):
  candidateprop, matchdirections, matchentities, nodelabels (flat_case — caused C-1 through C-5)
  matchEntities, nullBehavior, targetNode, idProperty (camelCase)
  Field(alias=...) — ZERO aliases, ever

---

## SECURITY — ZERO TOLERANCE

### Cypher Safety (CYPHERSAFETY.md)
NEVER interpolate user input, tenant, config values, or expressions into Cypher strings.

BANNED — instant block:
  f"MATCH (n:{variable}"          ← label injection
  f"WHERE n.mfi > {value}"        ← value injection
  f"LIMIT {top_n}"                ← LIMIT injection
  f"CALL gds.louvain.write({name}" ← GDS name injection
  str([list]) in any Cypher       ← Python repr, not valid JSON

CORRECT:
  label = sanitize_label(spec.target_node)
  cypher = f"MATCH (n:{label}) WHERE n.mfi > $min_mfi RETURN n LIMIT $limit"
  params = {"min_mfi": query["mfi"], "limit": top_n}
  results = await driver.execute_query(cypher, params, database=tenant)

For lists in GDS/Cypher:
  labels = json.dumps(["Facility", "Material"])   ← CORRECT (double-quoted JSON)
  labels = str(["Facility", "Material"])           ← BANNED (Python repr, single-quoted)

### Expression Evaluation
BANNED: eval(), exec(), compile() — anywhere in engine code, no exceptions, no "safe" wrappers.
CORRECT: Explicit operator dispatch table using operator module.

### Error Handling
NEVER: except Exception as e: return {"error": str(e)}  ← leaks Neo4j queries, file paths
CORRECT:
  except Exception as e:
      logger.error("Query failed", exc_info=e, tenant=tenant, trace_id=trace_id)
      raise ExecutionError(action="match", tenant=tenant, client_message="Match query failed.")

### No Bare Except
BANNED: bare `except:` or `except Exception: pass`
CORRECT: Catch specific exceptions, log with trace_id, re-raise as EngineError.

---

## WIRING CONTRACT

engine/handlers.py is the ONLY file that bridges engine and chassis.
It MUST:
  1. Define init_dependencies(graph_driver, domain_loader) — called at startup
  2. Define register_all(router) — called at startup, registers EVERY handler
  3. Register ALL actions: match, sync, admin, resolve-material (+ any added)
  4. Every handler: async def handle_<action>(tenant: str, payload: dict) -> dict

BANNED:
  - FastAPI APIRouter, app factory, routes — chassis owns all HTTP
  - from fastapi import anything — in engine code
  - from starlette import anything — in engine code
  - import uvicorn — in engine code

Self-check: Can a client reach EVERY handler via POST /v1/execute? If not, it doesn't exist.

---

## INTER-NODE COMMUNICATION

CEG communicates with ENRICH, GATE, SCORE, HEALTH via PacketEnvelope delegation only.

CORRECT:
  from l9.core.delegation import delegate_to_node
  response = await delegate_to_node(
      envelope=current_packet,
      target="enrichment-engine",
      action="enrich",
      payload={"entity_id": abc, "missing_fields": ["mfi", "capacity"]},
      permissions=["enrich"],
  )

BANNED:
  httpx.post(...)       ← in engine code
  requests.post(...)    ← in engine code
  Any direct HTTP call to another constellation node

---

## MEMORY / PERSISTENCE

To persist enrichment results, match events, or graph sync events:
  from l9.memory.ingestion import ingest_packet
  from l9.core.envelope import PacketEnvelopeIn, TenantContext
  await ingest_packet(PacketEnvelopeIn(
      packet_type="graphmatch",
      payload={...},
      tenant=TenantContext(actor="ceg", org_id=tenant),
  ))

BANNED:
  INSERT INTO packet_store directly
  INSERT INTO memory_embeddings directly
  (The memory substrate DAG handles embeddings, graph sync, insight extraction)

---

## SHARED MODELS — IMPORT, NEVER REDEFINE

BANNED (CRITICAL finding):
  class PacketEnvelope(BaseModel): ...    ← in engine code
  class TenantContext(BaseModel): ...     ← in engine code
  class ExecuteRequest(BaseModel): ...    ← in engine code

CORRECT:
  from l9.core.envelope import PacketEnvelope, TenantContext
  from l9.core.contract import ExecuteRequest

---

## PACKET TYPES — USE REGISTRY, NEVER INVENT

Valid packet_type values for CEG emissions (all lowercase snake_case):
  graph_sync       ← batch sync event
  graph_match      ← match query result
  gds_job          ← GDS algorithm result
  enrichment_request ← delegation to ENRICH
  score_record     ← score computation result (if CEG scores inline)
  api_request      ← inbound from chassis
  api_response     ← outbound via chassis

BANNED:
  "GRAPHMATCH", "GraphMatch", "matchresult", "syncEvent"  ← wrong case/naming

To add a new packet_type:
  1. Add to this file (contract)
  2. Add to PacketType enum in l9_packet_envelope.py
  3. Add validation in PacketValidator
  4. Update tools/audit_rules.yaml

---

## DOMAIN SPEC VERSIONING

Format: major.minor.patch-stage

Stages in order:
  seed        ← auto-generated from CRM field scan
  discovered  ← enrichment passes added fields
  inferred    ← inference engine derived fields
  proposed    ← auto-proposed gates/scoring
  reviewed    ← human-approved
  production  ← deployed and active

Example progression:
  0.1.0-seed → 0.2.0-discovered → 0.3.0-inferred → 1.0.0-production

Migration rules:
  - Never drop columns. ADD only.
  - Major bump: breaking ontology change (node/edge type renamed or removed).
  - Minor bump: new fields, gates, or scoring dimensions.
  - Patch bump: threshold/parameter tuning only.

---

## LOGGING

CORRECT:
  import logging
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  logger.info("Gate compilation complete", extra={"gate_count": 14, "tenant": tenant})

BANNED:
  structlog.configure(...)   ← chassis configures structlog
  logging.basicConfig(...)   ← chassis owns log config
  str(exc) in any response   ← leaks internals

---

## TESTING RULES

Every new engine/*.py file MUST have a corresponding tests/unit/test_*.py in the SAME response.
Test files NEVER go in engine/. Tests go in tests/ only.

Minimum coverage:
  - 1 test per public function
  - 1 test per error path
  - 1 test per edge case (null inputs, empty domain spec, unknown gate type)
  - Cypher-generating modules: assert output is parameterized, not interpolated
  - Security modules: assert malicious input is rejected

conftest.py fixtures:
  - Paths MUST be relative to repo root, not the test file
  - CORRECT: DomainPackLoader(domains_dir=Path(__file__).parent.parent / "domains")
  - WRONG:   DomainPackLoader(domains_dir=Path("domains"))

Self-check: If I run `pytest tests/ -x` right now, does the FIRST test pass?
If not, the test harness is broken and coverage is zero, not partial.

---

## NO ORPHANS RULE

Every function must be CALLED from somewhere.
Every file must be IMPORTED from somewhere.
Build tools go in tools/ or scripts/, NEVER in engine/ or domains/.
Template/reference files get a .template or .reference suffix.

Before finishing: grep for every function you defined. Verify it's called.
Before finishing: grep for every import you added. Verify it resolves.

---

## INFRASTRUCTURE RULES

ONE Dockerfile, parameterized with build args for dev/prod differences.
ONE entrypoint.sh — delete any duplicate.
NEVER `COPY . .` in production — use .dockerignore or explicit COPY paths.
Pin ALL dependency versions — no `pip install fastapi` without version.
Same Python version everywhere (3.12).
docker-compose.prod.yml must NOT expose debug ports or hardcode credentials.

---

---

## CHASSIS — ALREADY BUILT, NEVER REBUILD

The chassis handles: HTTP routing, auth (SHA-256 API key), rate limiting,
tenant resolution, ExecuteRequest/Response envelope, structlog config,
Prometheus metrics, health endpoint, trace ID generation.

You NEVER build or import: FastAPI app factory, APIRouter, middleware, CORS,
uvicorn config, auth logic, rate limiter logic.

Your handler receives: tenant: str, payload: dict
Your handler returns: dict
That is the entire interface.

---

## THE FOUNDER'S AUDIT QUESTION

After you deliver code, the founder will ask:
"Show me the wiring for every handler — trace the path from POST /v1/execute
to the handler function to the Cypher query to the response. Show me every file
in the chain."

If you can't produce this trace cleanly, the code has wiring gaps.
If any step uses f-strings for values in Cypher, it has injection bugs.
If any step is NotImplementedError, it has stubs.

This question catches root causes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10.

---

## DOMAIN EXAMPLE: PLASTICS RECYCLING (DEFAULT)

When illustrating concepts or generating default domain spec content:
  - Node types: Facility, Material, Buyer, Seller, Transaction
  - Key properties: hdpe_capacity, contamination_tolerance (0.0–0.05), mfi_range,
                    facility_tier (1–4), material_grade (A/B/B-/C/D), process_types,
                    food_grade (bool), certifications
  - Gates apply contamination tolerance thresholds, MFI range checks, taxonomy overlap
    on material types, geo radius for logistics feasibility
  - Scoring: fit_score weights material grade match; graph_affinity weights Louvain
    community membership; readiness_score applies temporal decay to last transaction date

This file governs all Cursor sessions in the CEG repo.
It supplements (does not replace):
  - L9_AI_Constellation_Infrastructure_Reference.md
  - L9_CONSTELLATION_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - L9_CONTRACT_SPECIFICATIONS.md
  - L9_Platform_Architecture.md

When in conflict: this file is more specific and takes precedence for CEG.
