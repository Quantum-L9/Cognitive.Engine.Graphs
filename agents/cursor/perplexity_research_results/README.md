# Research Results - Cursor Memory System

**Generated: 2026-01-15**
**Source: Perplexity deep_research API**

---

## Overview

This folder contains research outputs for implementing the remaining stages of the L9 Memory System as defined in `MEMORY-GMP-Cursor-SUPER-PROMPT-v1.0.md`.

## Files

| File | Stage | Components | Status |
|------|-------|------------|--------|
| `stage4_belief_revision_system.md` | Stage 4 | ExplanationEngine, ConflictResolver | Ready for adaptation |
| `stage5_predictive_memory_warming.md` | Stage 5 | GapDetector, PredictiveCache, ReasoningLoop | Ready for adaptation |
| `stage6_multi_agent_consensus.md` | Stage 6 | BeliefCalibrator, ConsensusSeeker, LeaderSelector | Ready for adaptation |

## Implementation Priority

Based on gap analysis against L9 codebase:

| Priority | Stage | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Stage 4 | Foundation for belief management, builds on existing substrate |
| 2 | Stage 5 | Enhances retrieval performance, integrates with existing Redis |
| 3 | Stage 6 | Multi-agent consensus, depends on calibration from Stage 4 |

## L9 Integration Strategy

### Shared Infrastructure

All stages will leverage existing L9 infrastructure:
- **PostgreSQL**: PacketStore for audit trails
- **pgvector**: Embedding storage and similarity search
- **Neo4j**: Graph relationships and traversal
- **Redis**: Caching layer
- **structlog**: Logging with L9 patterns

### Target Locations

```
memory/
├── explanation_engine.py      # Stage 4
├── conflict_resolver.py       # Stage 4
├── belief_system.py           # Stage 4 orchestration
├── gap_detector.py            # Stage 5
├── predictive_cache.py        # Stage 5
├── reasoning_loop.py          # Stage 5
├── warming_service.py         # Stage 5 production service
├── belief_calibrator.py       # Stage 6
├── consensus_seeker.py        # Stage 6
└── leader_selector.py         # Stage 6
```

### Required Migrations

- `migrations/0021_belief_revision.sql` - Stage 4 tables
- `migrations/0022_consensus_operations.sql` - Stage 6 tables

## GMP Execution Plan

Follow GMP v1.7 phases for each stage:

1. **Phase 0**: Lock TODO plan with file paths and actions
2. **Phase 1**: Baseline verification (existing tests pass)
3. **Phase 2**: Implementation with surgical edits
4. **Phase 3**: Add tests per GMP-Action-Tests
5. **Phase 4**: Run full test suite
6. **Phase 5**: Recursive verification against Phase 0 plan
7. **Phase 6**: Finalize and audit

## Next Steps

1. Create Phase 0 TODO plan for Stage 4
2. Review existing `memory/` files for integration points
3. Identify L9 patterns to follow (substrate_service, substrate_models)
4. Begin Stage 4 implementation

## Research Notes

The Perplexity research outputs include:
- Complete Pydantic v2 data models
- Production-grade async Python implementations
- PostgreSQL schemas with audit trails
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Comprehensive error handling

Code should be adapted to match L9's existing patterns:
- Use `PacketEnvelope` for audit logging
- Follow `substrate_service.py` patterns
- Integrate with existing embeddings infrastructure
- Use L9's database connection utilities
