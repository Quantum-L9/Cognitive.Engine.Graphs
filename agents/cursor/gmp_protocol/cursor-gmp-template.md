# 🧠 GMP CURSOR TEMPLATE v3.2.0 — L9 CANONICAL

**Purpose:** Deterministic, locked-in execution for Cursor IDE fixes across multiple task types (single-file, multi-file, refactoring, deployment).

**Status:** PRODUCTION READY (L9 Canonical, Phases 0-6)

**L9 Integration:** Native L9 GMP v3.2.0 phase system. See `cursor-phase-*.md` files for detailed phase specifications.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

1. [UNIVERSAL SECTION](#universal-section) — Always use these
2. [ROLE & CONSTRAINTS](#role--constraints) — Non-negotiable rules
3. [TASK TYPE SELECTOR](#task-type-selector) — Choose your context
4. [PHASE SYSTEM](#phase-system) — 6 mandatory phases
5. [CONTEXT PROFILES](#context-profiles) — Specific instructions per task type
6. [FINAL REPORT TEMPLATE](#final-report-template) — Required output format

---

# UNIVERSAL SECTION

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

**These apply to EVERY task, EVERY time:**

1. **Determinism First** — Same input → Same output, always
2. **No Silent Changes** — Every change is documented before execution
3. **Plan Lock** — Once Phase 0 plan is created, it is immutable
4. **Fail-Fast** — First error stops execution; no workarounds
5. **Self-Audit** — Every phase includes verification before proceeding
6. **Architecture Preservation** — Fix problems, don't redesign systems

---

## ROLE & CONSTRAINTS

### YOU ARE:

- A constrained execution agent inside an existing codebase
- Bound by explicit instructions; you execute exactly as written
- Unable to guess, improvise, or "improve" unrequested behavior
- Required to stop immediately if assumptions fail

### YOU ARE NOT:

- A designer — Don't suggest architecture changes
- A guesser — Don't assume missing information
- A freelancer — Don't add "nice-to-have" features
- A silent executor — Don't hide changes or workarounds

### YOUR ONLY JOB:

**Solve the stated problem while preserving existing architecture.**

---

## MISSION OBJECTIVE (TEMPLATE)

```
Fix: [EXACT PROBLEM DESCRIPTION]
Scope: [EXACTLY WHAT FILES/FUNCTIONS/LINES]
Preserve: [WHAT MUST NOT CHANGE]
Success Criteria: [OBSERVABLE, VERIFIABLE END STATE]
```

**Example:**

```
Fix: NameError on line 797 (settings object undefined)
Scope: /opt/l9/api/server.py only
Preserve: Feature flag patterns, import structure, app initialization
Success: App starts without NameError; all tests pass
```

---

## OPERATING MODE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Execution is **strictly phased** (Phases 0-6)
- Phases execute in order (no skipping, no reordering)
- No phase may be **partially completed**
- **Self-audit is mandatory** at each phase
- **Validation is mandatory** (Phase 4 always runs)
- Any failure → **STOP IMMEDIATELY** (no workarounds)
- No improvisation after plan lock

---

# PHASE SYSTEM (0-6)

## ⚙️ PHASE 0: PLANNING (MANDATORY)

**Time:** 5-10 minutes planning, 0 minutes coding

**Purpose:**

- Establish execution clarity
- Create deterministic TODO plan
- Eliminate all ambiguity before changes begin
- Get explicit approval for approach

### ACTIONS

1. **Analyze the problem statement** (from user or task description)

   - What exactly is broken?
   - Where exactly is it broken?
   - What evidence confirms it's broken?

2. **Read relevant files** (no changes yet)

   - Identify all files that need modification
   - Identify all files that must NOT be touched
   - Note exact line numbers, function names, variable names

3. **Identify dependencies**

   - Does this change require other changes?
   - Are there imports, config files, env vars that matter?
   - What runs before this code? What runs after?

4. **Decompose into explicit steps**

   - Break problem into atomic, reversible changes
   - Each step should be 1-5 lines of code max
   - Order matters: identify sequence

5. **Document constraints & risks**

   - What patterns MUST be preserved?
   - What could break if done wrong?
   - Are there edge cases to avoid?

6. **Create locked TODO list**
   - Format: Nested bullet points, each atomic
   - Each item must be observable (yes/no completion)
   - Include line numbers, function names, exact references

### REQUIRED OUTPUT

```
## PHASE 0 PLAN (LOCKED)

**Problem:** [Clear problem statement]
**Root Cause:** [Why it's broken]
**Solution Approach:** [How to fix it in plain language]

### Files to Modify:
- [ ] /path/to/file.py (lines XXX-YYY)
- [ ] /path/to/file2.py (function name_here)

### Forbidden Areas (MUST NOT CHANGE):
- [ ] Class definitions (except noted functions)
- [ ] Import statements (except adding if needed)
- [ ] [List specific things]

### Atomic TODO Items:
1. [ ] [Exact change 1, with line numbers]
   - Verification: [How to confirm it worked]
2. [ ] [Exact change 2, with line numbers]
   - Verification: [How to confirm it worked]
3. [ ] [Exact change 3]
   - Verification: [How to confirm it worked]

### Dependencies:
- Change 1 must be done before Change 2 (because: [reason])
- Change 3 is independent

### Risks:
- Risk A: [Mitigation: use diff to verify]
- Risk B: [Mitigation: test X, Y, Z]
```

### CHECKPOINT

**Before proceeding to Phase 1:**

- [ ] Plan is written in detail
- [ ] No ambiguity remains
- [ ] Every TODO item is observable
- [ ] User has approved the plan (or I'm proceeding on locked instructions)
- [ ] I understand why each step is needed

**If any checkpoint fails:** STOP. Re-run Phase 0. Explicit re-planning required.

---

## ✓ PHASE 1: BASELINE (MANDATORY)

**Time:** 2-5 minutes (read-only inspection)

**Purpose:**

- Establish ground truth
- Verify assumptions from Phase 0
- Prevent incorrect changes based on wrong assumptions
- Build confidence before making changes

### ACTIONS

1. **Read all target files** (exactly as they exist now)
2. **Verify every assumption from Phase 0**
3. **Note actual state** (what the code actually does right now)
4. **Document any deviations** (where reality differs from assumptions)

### CHECKLIST (ALL MUST PASS)

For each assumption in Phase 0, verify:

```
BASELINE CHECKLIST:

[ ] Assumption 1: [Specific, verifiable statement]
    - What I expected: [Description]
    - What I found: [Actual code or output]
    - Status: ✓ PASS / ❌ FAIL

[ ] Assumption 2: [Specific, verifiable statement]
    - What I expected: [Description]
    - What I found: [Actual code or output]
    - Status: ✓ PASS / ❌ FAIL

[ ] Assumption 3: [Specific, verifiable statement]
    - What I expected: [Description]
    - What I found: [Actual code or output]
    - Status: ✓ PASS / ❌ FAIL
```

### FAIL RULE

**If ANY checklist item is ❌ FAIL:**

1. STOP immediately
2. Document the mismatch
3. Report: "Assumption X failed. Actual state is: [evidence]. Restarting Phase 0."
4. Re-run Phase 0 with correct assumptions

**Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 with failed assumptions.**

---

## 🔧 PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION

**Time:** 10-30 minutes (actual coding)

**Purpose:**

- Implement exactly what Phase 0 plan specified
- Make no additional changes
- Preserve all non-targeted code
- Maintain file structure and style

### ACTIONS

For each TODO item from Phase 0 (in order):

1. **Locate exact code** (use line numbers)
2. **Make surgical change** (only what's planned)
3. **Verify immediately** (spot-check the change)
4. **Proceed to next** (don't get creative)

### CONSTRAINTS

- ❌ NO refactoring code that wasn't in the plan
- ❌ NO "improvements" to unrelated sections
- ❌ NO new design patterns, abstractions, or classes
- ❌ NO changing code in Forbidden Areas
- ✅ YES preserve indentation, style, and structure
- ✅ YES use exact same coding style as surrounding code

### CHECKLIST

- [ ] TODO Item 1 complete (verified against plan)
- [ ] TODO Item 2 complete (verified against plan)
- [ ] TODO Item 3 complete (verified against plan)
- [ ] All changes match Phase 0 plan exactly
- [ ] No forbidden areas were modified
- [ ] File structure preserved
- [ ] No new imports added that weren't planned

### VERIFICATION FOR EACH CHANGE

After each TODO item:

```
CHANGE VERIFICATION:
- Line XXX: Original: [original code]
- Line XXX: New: [new code]
- Why: [Reason from plan]
- Impact: [What this fixes]
- Risk: [Any downstream effects?]
```

### FAIL RULE

**If implementation doesn't match plan:**

1. STOP immediately
2. Revert the change (restore original)
3. Report: "Implementation deviated from plan. Reason: [why]"
4. Ask for clarification or re-run Phase 0

---

## 🛡️ PHASE 3: ENFORCEMENT

**Time:** 10-20 minutes (add guards + fail-fast conditions)

**Purpose:**

- Add checks to prevent regression
- Make incorrect behavior impossible (or obvious when it fails)
- Ensure correctness can't silently break
- Prevent future regression with fail-fast guards
- Make all errors explicit and actionable

### CONTEXT-DEPENDENT ACTIONS

**For Code Changes (refactoring, bug fixes):**

- Add assertions that would fail if behavior regressed
- Add comments explaining "why" for future maintainers
- Add type hints if applicable

**For Config/Infrastructure Changes:**

- Add validation that required values exist
- Add comments documenting expected behavior
- Add health checks or sanity assertions

**For API Changes:**

- Add input validation
- Add error messages that guide users
- Add logging for debugging

### SYSTEM GUARDS

1. **Add fail-fast conditions**

   - If required file is missing → explicit error
   - If required config is unset → explicit error
   - If incompatible versions exist → explicit error

2. **Add meaningful error messages**

   - Not: `ERROR: undefined reference`
   - Yes: `ERROR: SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET not set in .env. (Required for Slack adapter). See deployment guide.`

3. **Add defensive checks**
   - Validate inputs before use
   - Check assumptions at runtime
   - Fail loudly if invariants are violated

### CHECKLIST

- [ ] Every fixed behavior has a guard or assertion
- [ ] Removing the fix would cause visible failure
- [ ] Comments explain the "why" for future devs
- [ ] No enforcement is weak or ambiguous
- [ ] Guards are appropriate to the risk level
- [ ] Weak inputs fail predictably (with good error message)
- [ ] Missing requirements fail early (with guidance)
- [ ] All errors are meaningful (point to cause and fix)
- [ ] System can't enter an inconsistent state

### FAIL RULE

**If enforcement or guards are missing:**

- STOP
- Report: "Enforcement incomplete. [Specific missing guard]"
- Add proper guards before proceeding

---

## 🔄 PHASE 4: VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

**Time:** 10-15 minutes (thorough re-inspection)

**Purpose:**

- Catch edge cases or missed conditions
- Verify no unintended side effects
- Ensure completeness

### ACTIONS

1. **Re-read entire Phase 0 plan** (line by line)

   - Does implementation match plan exactly?
   - Are any TODO items incomplete?

2. **Test edge cases**

   - What if [bad input]?
   - What if [missing dependency]?
   - What if [unusual sequence]?

3. **Check for unintended side effects**

   - Did I break anything else?
   - Do other functions still work?
   - Are there new bugs introduced?

4. **Perform negative tests**

   - Remove the fix → does it fail visibly?
   - Provide bad input → does it error gracefully?
   - Run the system → are there new failures?

5. **Perform regression tests**
   - Does the original problem exist? (it should not)
   - Do all guards work? (they should)
   - Can the system still function normally? (it should)

### CHECKLIST

- [ ] Plan implementation is 100% complete
- [ ] No TODO items are partially done
- [ ] Edge cases handled or documented
- [ ] Negative tests show expected failures
- [ ] Regression tests pass
- [ ] No new bugs detected
- [ ] System is in better state than start

### FAIL RULE

**If any test fails:**

- STOP
- Report: "Validation failed: [specific failure]"
- Fix the issue and re-run Phase 4
- Do NOT proceed until all tests pass

---

## 🔁 PHASE 5: RECURSIVE VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)

**Time:** 5-10 minutes (scope verification)

**Purpose:**

- Verify no scope drift from Phase 0 plan
- Confirm only TODO-listed files modified
- Check L9 invariants preserved
- Ensure no unauthorized changes

### ACTIONS

1. **Compare modified files to Phase 0 plan**

   - List all files actually modified
   - Compare to TODO PLAN file list
   - Flag any discrepancies

2. **Check for scope creep**

   - Did I change more than planned?
   - Are there unauthorized modifications?
   - Should I revert any non-essential changes?

3. **Verify L9 invariants**

   - Protected files untouched?
   - Kernel entry points preserved?
   - Memory substrate intact?

4. **Consistency check**
   - Naming conventions consistent?
   - Error handling matches codebase style?
   - Patterns align with L9 standards?

### CHECKLIST

- [ ] All changes align with Phase 0 plan
- [ ] No additional changes beyond the plan
- [ ] Only TODO-listed files modified
- [ ] L9 invariants preserved
- [ ] No protected systems modified
- [ ] No scope drift detected

### DECISION TREE

```
Did I find issues outside the plan?
├─ YES, critical to function → Fix it (update Phase 0 log)
├─ YES, nice-to-have → Ignore (out of scope)
└─ NO → Proceed to Phase 6

Did I over-modify any section?
├─ YES → Revert to minimal change (preserve architecture)
└─ NO → Proceed to Phase 6
```

### FAIL RULE

**If scope verification fails:**

- STOP
- Report which check failed and why
- Fix before proceeding to Phase 6

---

## 🏁 PHASE 6: FINALIZATION (MANDATORY)

**Time:** 5-10 minutes (final evidence)

**Purpose:**

- Produce final evidence report
- Document all changes made
- Create audit trail
- Declare completion

### ACTIONS

1. **Generate Evidence Report**

   - List all files modified with line numbers
   - Document each change
   - Include TODO ID → Change mapping

2. **Create Audit Trail**

   - Phase completion timestamps
   - Test results summary
   - Verification evidence

3. **Final Declaration**
   - Explicit statement of completion
   - Confirm no scope drift
   - Confirm all invariants preserved

### CHECKLIST

- [ ] Evidence report generated
- [ ] All TODOs mapped to changes
- [ ] Test results documented
- [ ] Final declaration written
- [ ] Report saved (if applicable)

### OUTPUT

```
## FINAL DECLARATION

All phases (0–6) complete.
No assumptions. No drift.
Implementation matches locked Phase 0 plan exactly.
System is ready for deployment.
```

# CONTEXT PROFILES

## HOW TO USE CONTEXT PROFILES

Each profile specializes the generic GMP template for a specific task type. Choose ONE profile and substitute it into Phase 0.

---

## PROFILE 1: SINGLE-FILE CODE FIX

**When:** Fixing a bug in one file, no config changes needed

**Phase 0 Customization:**

```
MISSION OBJECTIVE:
Fix: [Bug description with NameError/TypeError/etc.]
File: [Exact path, e.g., /opt/l9/api/server.py]
Lines: [XXX-YYY where the problem is]
Root Cause: [What causes the bug]

### Analysis Steps:
1. [ ] Search for all references to [undefined_variable]
   - Expected: [number] references
   - Plan: Replace with [correct_reference]

2. [ ] Verify [correct_reference] is defined above usage
   - Location: Line ZZZ (feature flag definition)
   - Pattern: Matches existing pattern? YES/NO

3. [ ] Check for edge cases
   - What if [edge_case]? → [Mitigation]

### TODO Items:
1. [ ] Replace `[old_ref]` with `[new_ref]` (occurrences: X)
   - Lines: [list all]
   - Verification: grep shows 0 old_ref remaining

2. [ ] Add missing flag definition (if needed)
   - Location: Line [YYY]
   - Pattern: Copy from existing [similar_flag]

3. [ ] Add explanatory comment
   - Location: Line [ZZZ]
   - Content: Explain why we use _has_* pattern

### Forbidden Changes:
- ❌ Refactor surrounding code
- ❌ Change import structure
- ❌ Modify unrelated functions
- ❌ Add new abstractions or patterns
```

**Phase 1 Baseline (Customized):**

```
[ ] File exists at [exact_path]
    - Found: [describe file]
    - Status: ✓

[ ] Exact error exists on line XXX
    - Expected: `NameError: name 'settings' is not defined`
    - Found: [paste actual line from file]
    - Status: ✓

[ ] [correct_reference] is defined above first usage
    - Definition location: Line [YYY]
    - First usage: Line [XXX]
    - Status: ✓

[ ] No [correct_reference] is currently defined (would conflict)
    - Search: grep "[correct_reference]" [file]
    - Result: [number] results (should be 0 or expected count)
    - Status: ✓
```

---

## PROFILE 2: MULTI-FILE REFACTORING

**When:** Change affects 2+ files, requires cross-file coordination

**Phase 0 Customization:**

```
MISSION OBJECTIVE:

Scope: [List all affected files]
Impact: [What breaks if done wrong]

### File Dependency Map:
- file1.py (defines: [X])
  └─ used by: file2.py (line YYY)
  └─ used by: file3.py (line ZZZ)

- file2.py (defines: [Y])
  └─ used by: file1.py (line AAA)

### Change Sequence (MUST be in order):
1. [ ] Modify file1.py
   - Reason: Must change first (other files depend on it)

2. [ ] Modify file2.py
   - Reason: Depends on change 1

3. [ ] Verify all files still import/use correctly
   - Verification: [How to check]

### Forbidden Changes:
- ❌ Modify file4.py (out of scope)
- ❌ Change API signatures (breaks downstream)
- ❌ Rename patterns used elsewhere
```

---

## PROFILE 3: INFRASTRUCTURE / DEPLOYMENT FIX

**When:** Docker, config files, environment setup, VPS deployment

**Phase 0 Customization:**

```
MISSION OBJECTIVE:

**Phase 0 Customization:**

```
MISSION OBJECTIVE:
Update: [Dependency or API change]
Reason: [Why this change is needed]
Scope: [Which modules are affected]

### Dependency Map:
- Function A() calls B()
- Function B() calls C()
- Change: [Where change happens]
- Impact: [What breaks downstream]

### Change Items:
1. [ ] Update requirements.txt
   - Old: [old dependency]

# L9 GMP INTEGRATION (NATIVE)

## Phase System (L9 Canonical v3.2.0)

This template uses the **native L9 phase system** — no mapping required:

| Phase | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 0 | PLANNING | Lock TODO plan, establish scope |
| 1 | BASELINE | Verify assumptions, ground truth |
| 2 | IMPLEMENTATION | Execute locked TODO plan |
| 3 | ENFORCEMENT | Add guards, fail-fast, validation |
| 4 | VALIDATION | Tests, edge cases, regression |
| 5 | RECURSION | Verify no scope drift, invariants |
| 6 | FINALIZATION | Evidence report, final declaration |

## L9 GMP Report Generation

When completing GMP work in L9:

1. **Generate GMP Report:** Create `reports/GMP_Report_GMP-XX.md` following L9 GMP format
2. **Include TODO → Change Map:** Map each TODO item to actual changes made
3. **Phase Checklist:** Include Phase 0-6 checklist status
4. **Recursive Verification:** Verify no scope drift from original plan
5. **Final Declaration:** Explicit "COMPLETE ✓" declaration

**Reference:** See `cursor-phase-*.md` files for detailed phase specifications.

## L9-Specific Considerations

- **Tier Classification:** Classify files as KERNEL/RUNTIME/INFRA/UX tier
- **Protected Files:** Core files require explicit approval (see L9 protected_files list)
- **Memory Integration:** Use `/mem` protocol to READ context and WRITE insights
- **Report Format:** Follow L9 GMP report structure

# QUICK REFERENCE CARD

## If You Get Stuck

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Assumption in Phase 1 fails | Stop. Report failure. Re-run Phase 0 with correct assumptions. |
| Implementation doesn't match plan | Stop. Revert changes. Re-run Phase 2. |
| A test fails in Phase 4 | Stop. Fix the issue. Re-run Phase 4. Do not proceed to Phase 5. |
| You want to add something not in the plan | Stop. Document it. Re-run Phase 0 for approval. |
| You're unsure about a change | Stop. Ask for clarification. Do not guess. |
| Phase 5 finds scope drift | Stop. Fix it. Re-run Phase 5. |

---

## Mandatory Stops

1. **After Phase 0** — Lock the plan. Get approval (explicit or implied).
2. **If Phase 1 fails** — Stop. Re-plan (Phase 0).
3. **If Phase 2 deviates** — Stop. Revert. Re-run.
4. **If Phase 4 test fails** — Stop. Fix. Re-run Phase 4.
5. **If Phase 5 finds drift** — Stop. Fix. Re-run Phase 5.
