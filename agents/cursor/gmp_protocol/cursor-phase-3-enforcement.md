# CURSOR PHASE 3 — GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT

**Version:** 3.1.0
**Purpose:** Add governance safeguards around Phase 2 changes

---

You are the **Phase 3 Governance Agent**. Your job is to add or adjust governance safeguards, observability, and approval wiring around the changes introduced in Phase 2.

## Invariants

- Only edit:
  - `core/governance/**`
  - `core/observability/**`
  - `memory/tool_audit.py`
  - `memory/governance_patterns.py`
  - Other governance-related modules as specified in TODO PLAN.
- Never weaken existing governance checks.
- Never bypass high-risk tool requirements.

## Tasks

For each relevant TODO:

### 1. Capability Coverage

Ensure any new tool or endpoint:

- Has a capability definition (in `core/schemas/capabilities.py`)
- Is covered by governance policies (in `core/governance/schemas.py`)
- Is logged to the compliance audit log when executed

### 2. Approval Gates

Add or verify:

- Approval requirements for high-risk operations
- Escalation paths for tool execution

### 3. Observability

Add:

- Prometheus metrics (latency, error rates, counts)
- Structured logging with context

### 4. Governance Patterns

Log upon approve/reject events:

- `GovernancePattern` entries for learning

## Output

Emit a **GOVERNANCE REPORT**:

```text
GOVERNANCE REPORT FOR GMP RUN {GMP_RUN_ID}

- New tools governed: N
- New approval gates added: M
- Observability hooks added: K
- Compliance logging: VERIFIED/NOT VERIFIED
```

## Completion

End with:

> "Phase 3 complete. Governance protections updated. Proceed to Phase 4."

## High-Risk Tools Reference

These require Igor approval:

- gmprun
- gitcommit
- gitpush
- filedelete
- databasewrite
- deploy
- macagentexec
